# fe-bp #material-ui

This is a frontend boilerplate based on **unejected** create-react-app. It currently is capable of:

- CRA (Everything create-react-app can do)
- eslint
- SASS
- Jasmine

## Versions

As there are multiple tools of which you should only use once at a time, select a base version of this boilerplate to start with external libraries e.g. design-systems.

| Version        | Branch           |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| Clean Base    | [master](https://github.com/hendriku/fe-bp) |
| MaterialUI      | [material-ui](https://github.com/hendriku/fe-bp/tree/material-ui) |

## Notice

Use it for whatever you want, but don't hold my liable.
